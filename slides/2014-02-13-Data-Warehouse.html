# Data Warehouse

---

## Database Types

  + Data Warehouse
    + Database designed for using data to make decisions
  + OLAP
    + OnLine Analytical Processing
  + OLTP
    + OnLine Transactional Processing

???

## Data Mining

  + These databases are often the starting point for data mining in companies
  + Most of the data sets from companies typically come from exporting some
    portion of their data warehouse

---

## Properties

  + Subject Oriented
    + Focus on core business objects
  + Integrated
    + Access to as much data as possible
  + Time Variant
    + Contains historical data with time parameter
  + Non-volatile
    + Updated (relatively) infrequently, in bulk

???

## Examples

  + Yelp users can be directed to a datacenter depending on conditions. This
    data probably doesn't need to be in the DW
  + Yelp has several databases: log summaries, user info, salesforce. Most
    useful if they are all in the same place
  + Operationally, when someone changes their address, we just overwrite it in
    the OLTP DB. But DW potentially cares about the old value
  + OLTP writes to rows every time someone updates profile, review, etc. Lots of
    simultaneous updates. DW: typically once a day, in bulk

---

## OLAP or OLTP?

  + Transactional Focus vs. Analytic Focus

## OLAP or OLTP?

  + Transactional Focus vs. Analytic Focus
  + Used by Managers, Executives vs. DBAs, programmers

---

## Overview

<img src="img/olap-overview.png" width=100%/>

???

## From the front

  + Analytics team uses charts, reports, etc.
  + Generated from an OLAP server
  + Which uses data from a data warehouse (often DW and OLAP server are
    integrated)
  + Uses a process (ETL) to move the data from other source into DW

---

## Types of Data Warehouses

  + Enterprise
    + turnkey solution, often expensive, sophisticated but complex
      ingestion, integration, security features
  + Data Mart
    + Smaller, limited in scope. Designed for specific team or
      department
  + Virtual
    + OLAP built on top of an OLTP database
  + Cloud
    + Google BigQuery
    + Amazon Redshift

???

## Vendors

  + Enterprise
    + Oracle
    + Greenplum
    + AsterData
  + Data Mart
    + MySQL
    + PostgreSQL
  + Virtual
    + MySQL
    + PostgreSQL
    + views or admin interface

---

## Metadata

  + Data about the data being stored
  + Overview: schema, languages
  + Operational: last update, query latency
  + Algorithms: normalization, transformation
  + Performance: job dependencies
  + Business: ownership, permissions

???

## Considerations

  + As soon as several people start using the DW, they'll need to know about
    how it is put together
  + Metadata often comes as an after thought but is an important part of
    scaling

---

## Data Cubes

  + What are those cubes in the OLAP area?

---

## Data Cubes

.left-column[

  + Way of thinking about multi dimensional data
  + Useful metaphor because one can reason about ways to satisfy a query
]

.right-column[
<img src="img/BorgFirstContact.jpg"/>
]

---

## Dimensions

|          | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Region 1 | $200  | $80   | $600  |
| Region 2 | $300  | $90   | $650  |
| Region 3 | $400  | $100  | $700  |

???

## Data... Square

  + More of a data square: only 2 dimensions
  + Advertising on Yelp
  + Now we want to know Product Type (CPC, CPM, National)

---

## Cube: 3rd Dimension

<img src="img/cube-3d.gif" width=60% />

???

## More

  + Now we want to know Page Type (Business, Search, Home)
  + Hard to draw 4 dimensions, so instead...

---

## Multi-Cube

<img src="img/cube-4d.png" width=100% />

???

## More

  + Keep adding dimension as necessary

---

## Lattice

<img src="img/cube-lattice.jpg" width=100% />

???

## Moving

  + Move back and forth from our 2d table
  + To our 3d cube, to our 4d multi-cube
  + The lower dimensional parts are summaries
  + At the extreme is just the total (i.e., all money made)

---

## Schemas

  + A *Data Cube* is a way of visualizing multi dimensional data

## Schema Name?

  + Any guesses what this fractal looking schema is called?

---

## Snowflake Schema

  + Schema with radiating dimension tables

<img src="img/star-snowflake.jpg" width=80% />

---

## Constellation Schema

  + Schema with several fact tables and related dimensions

<img src="img/star-constilation.jpg" width=100% />

---

## Data Warehouse Operations

  + Rollup
    + Summarize data along fewer dimensions
  + Drill-down
    + Get details within a particular dimension
  + Slice
    + Select a particular value in a dimension
  + Dice
    + Consider a subset of the values in a dimension
  + Pivot
    + Swap, or rotate dimensions

???

## Examples

  + Rollup
    + What countries are selling the most ads?
  + Drill-down
    + Spike in Q1 ad views. Which month most responsible?
  + Slice
    + Chart sales only for CPC
  + Dice
    + Only look at sales in US, IT, DE
  + Pivot
    + Swap axis on a chart

---

## Materialized Views

  + View
    + virtual table defined by a query
  + Non-materialized
    + Calculate summaries on the fly
  + Fully materialized
    + Pre-compute and store
  + Partially materialized
    + Variety of strategies: e.g., cache results after calculating

???

## Usefulness

  + In DW, we're often storing different cubes in the lattice
  + For the country sample, do we have those summaries stored in another DB
    table? On disk? By month? Year?
  + Storing all possible summaries is expensive when loading data,
    and requires a lot more storage

---

## Architecture

  + ROLAP
    + Relational. Implement OLAP on top of a relational database
  + MOLAP
    + Multidimensional. Implements data cube as storage paradigm
  + HOLAP
    + Hybrid. Data in ROLAP, rollups in MOLAP
  + Specialized
    + Often distributed storage, parallel DB technology
  + NoSQL
    + Store data as key-value pairs, optimized in different ways

???

## Details

  + ROLAP: MySQL, PostgreSQL
  + MOLAP: Oracle, Palo
  + HOLAP: Microsoft SQL Server
  + Specialized: AsterData, Greenplumb
  + NoSQL: Hive, BigTable, Cassandra
