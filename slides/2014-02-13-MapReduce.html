# MapReduce

???

## Spoilers

  + Don't look ahead in the slides
  + If you know MapReduce, try to let others answer and genuinely think about
    how *you* would solve the problem.

---

## Yelp has a problem

  + 2+ TB of logs per day
  + Each GB takes at least 2 minutes to process
  + How long to handle a day's logs?

<img src="img/yelp-growth.png" width=100% />

???

## Too long

  + On a single machine 65+ hours!
  + If we really had only a single machine, we wouldn't be able to keep up!
  + Mistake can't be fixed in a day (billing especially important)

---

## Solution?

  + Don't use one machine!
  + What are the new challenges?

---


## Solution?

  + Don't use one machine!
  + What are the new challenges?
    + Distributing data
    + Calculating overall statistics
    + Failures

???

## New Challenges

  + With many machines, how do they get access to the 2 TB of logs?
  + How do they coordinate who gets which section of logs?
  + How do we calculate the average?
  + What happens when one of the boxes dies?
    + Detecting failure (timeout waiting for data? Out of band?)
    + Decide who takes over the data

---

## Do It Yourself

  + There are many ways to deal with these challenges
  + Often, people would "roll" their own solutions depending on the problem

???

## Dependencies

  + Did you have a super-computer?
  + What programming language were you using?
  + Type of problem being solved (working on graphs, or web logs, ...)

---

## MapReduce

  + Google implemented a generic solution and shared the idea

<img src="img/mapreduce-paper.png"/>

???

http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html

---

## Big Idea

  + Simplify, limit solution expression
  + Enable sophisticated implementation

### Interface

  + mapper()
  + reducer()

### Implementation

  + Reliably use 1,000s of machines for each job

???

## Really Big Idea

  + Limiting yourself to what can be expressed may seem like a loss
  + But it enables the implementation to handle the problems we talked about
  + And then can be used as understandable building blocks

---

## MapReduce

  + Mapper
    + Extracts a property to summarize over
  + Reducer
    + Summarizes all items with a particular property

### Simple Constraint

+ Each operation is stateless

???

## Reading

  + Reading this week includes a video explaining MapReduce much more generally
  + This lecture will focus on it from a practical standpoint for homework
  + MapReduce's main benefits are for running on many machines, with fault
    tolerance
  + But we'll just practice on one machine

---

## Example

  + Web application logs
  + Question: How many instance of each of these actions have we seen?
    + Business views
    + User profile views
    + Searches

???

## Details

  + Business Views: [I.B.'s Hoagies](http://www.yelp.com/biz/i-b-s-hoagies-berkeley) or [Gypsy's Trattoria Italiano](http://www.yelp.com/biz/gypsys-trattoria-italiano-berkeley)
  + User profile: [Jimmy](http://jretz.yelp.com)
  + Searches: [cheese near Downtown Berkeley](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=cheese&find_loc=Downtown+Berkeley%2C+Berkeley%2C+CA&ns=1)

---

## Logs

```json
{'page_type': 'search',
'user': 'jimmy', 'query': ...}

{'page_type': 'biz_view',
'user': 'shreyas', 'biz_id': 55}

{'page_type': 'user_profile',
'user': null, 'profile_id: 123}

...
```

???

## Logs

    + JSON logs, various types of information
    + entire record on one line (wrapped for slides)

---

## Mapper

  + Input: Key, Value
  + Output: Keys, Values

---

## Mapper Example

  + Input Key: Log line number
  + Input Value: Log line text
  + Output Key: Action
  + Output Value: times this action occurred *on this line*

???

## Counts

  + Log line number is not helpful in our specific case
  + Log line text: we hope it is machine readable so we can accurately extract
    the action
    + It has datetime, cookie, action, etc.
  + How many times has this action occurred? 1
  + Tunnel vision: all we care about is this line

---

## Actions?

```text
search       1
biz_view     1
user_profile 1
search       1
biz_view     1
search       1
biz_view     1
user_profile 1
search       1
```

???

## Middle Step

  + From log lines, we've extracted the information out that we care about
  + The counts and the actions
  + Next step summarize
  + Next step after Mapper?

---

## Reducer

  + Input: Key, Values
  + Output: Keys, Values

???

## Values

  + Note: The input is value*s* (plural)
  + Because we get a key and all of its associated values
  + Remind me: what are we trying to get out of this computation?
  + So what do you think the output keys are?
  + Values?

---

## Reducer Example

  + Input Key: Action
  + Input Values: Counts: ```[1, 1, 1, 1]```
  + Output Key: Action
  + Output Value: Total Count

???

## Details

  + Action is *one of* search/biz_view/profile_view
  + To get total count, sum all of the counts

---

## Example Output

  + Output Key: Action
  + Output Value: Total Count
```html
"search"       4
"user_profile" 2
"biz_view"     3
```

---

## Point?

  + A lot of work for counting!
  + More complex calculations can be done this way, eg. PageRank
  + Stateless constraint means it can be used across thousands of computers

???

## Details

  + By only looking at keys and values, can optimize a lot of back-end work
  + Where to send the results?
  + What to do when a computer fails? (Just restart failed part)

---

## Implementation

```text
biz_view     1
user_profile 1
search       1
search       1
biz_view     1
search       1
biz_view     1
user_profile 1
search       1
```

???

## Intermediate

  + This was the situation after map
  + Keys all jumbled
  + What Hadoop does is sort them and distribute them to computers

---

## "Shuffle"

```text
biz_view     1
biz_view     1
biz_view     1
search       1
search       1
search       1
search       1
user_profile 1
user_profile 1
```

???

## Distribute

  + Now it is easy to distribute, and can handle all the ```biz_view``` at once

---

## Inputs

  + MapReduce distributes computing power by distributing input
  + Input is distributed by splitting on lines (records)
  + You cannot depend on lines being "together" in MapReduce

???

## Splitting Files

  + Imagine you have a lot of large log files, GBs each
  + You'd like to let different machines work on the same file
  + Split file down the middle, well, at least on a newline
  + Enable two separate machines to work on the parts
  + You don't know what line came before this one
  + You don't know if you will process the next line
  + Only view is this line
  + Real life slightly more complicated, but mostly hacks around this

---

## Word Count

.tight-code[
```json
{"text": "Greatest pizza ever", "stars": 2, "user": ...}
{"text": "good pizza selection", "stars": 5, "user": ...}
```
]
  + Total uses of a word across all reviews

???

## Classic

  + This is the traditional MapReduce example, so let's solve it
  + No skipping ahead

---

## Steps

???

## Hints

  + What's the first step of MapReduce?

---

## Steps

  + Mapper

???

## Hints

  + What part of the record are we interested in?

---

## Steps

  + Mapper
  + Extract the ```text``` of the review

???

## Hints

  + What do we want to do with the text?

---

## Steps

  + Mapper
  + Extract the ```text``` of the review
  + Split text up into words

???

## Hints

  + Mapper: Key / Value? What are we grouping by?

---

## Steps

  + Mapper
  + Extract the ```text``` of the review
  + Split text up into words
  + Key: word ; Value: count

???

## Hints

  + Next step of MapReduce?

---

## Steps

  + Mapper
  + Extract the ```text``` of the review
  + Split text up into words
  + Key: word ; Value: count
  + Reducer

???

## Hints

  + What are the reducer inputs?

---

## Steps

  + Mapper
  + Extract the ```text``` of the review
  + Split text up into words
  + Key: word ; Value: count
  + Reducer
  + Key: word ; Values: all counts for that word

???

## Hints

  + With all of these counts, how do we summarize?

---

## Steps

  + Mapper
  + Extract the ```text``` of the review
  + Split text up into words
  + Key: word ; Value: count
  + Reducer
  + Key: word ; Values: all counts for that word
  + ```sum(values)```

---

## Example

  + ```"Greatest pizza ever"```
  + Mapper

---

## Example

  + ```"Greatest pizza ever"```
  + Mapper
    + Greatest: ```1```

---

## Example

  + ```"Greatest pizza ever"```
  + Mapper
    + Greatest: ```1```
    + pizza: ```1```

---

## Example

  + ```"Greatest pizza ever"```
  + Mapper
    + Greatest: ```1```
    + pizza: ```1```
    + ever: ```1```

---

## Example

  + ```"Greatest pizza ever"```
  + Mapper
    + Greatest: ```1```
    + pizza: ```1```
    + ever: ```1```
  + Reducer
    + Key: ```pizza```
    + Values: ```[1, 1]```

---

## Example

  + ```"Greatest pizza ever"```
  + Mapper
    + Greatest: ```1```
    + pizza: ```1```
    + ever: ```1```
  + Reducer
    + Key: ```pizza```
    + Values: ```[1, 1]```
    + Output: ```["pizza", 2]```

---

## Multi-Step

  + Not all computations can be done in a single MapReduce step
  + Map Input: ```<key, value>```
  + Reducer Output: ```<key, value>```
  + Compose MapReduce steps!

???

## Output as Input

  + The output of one MapReduce job can be used as the input to another

---

## Examples

  + PageRank: Multiple steps till solution converges
  + Multi-level summaries

???

## PageRank

  + PageRank is an algorithm for calculating the importance of a page
  + But it depends on the importance of every page pointing to it!
  + So iteratively calculate the importance of all pages
  + Find average presidential donations by candidate, then normalize averages

---
