* Frequent Patterns :slide:

* Finding Patterns :slide:
  + Cookies frequently purchased with milk
  + Website signups frequently occurring after reading FAQ
  + DNA sections frequently seen with a drug reaction
** Patterns :notes:
   + set of items
   + subsequences of actions
   + substructures
   + Generalized to any kind of pattern that occurs "frequently" in the dataset

* Market Basket :slide:
  + What things are frequently purchased together?
  + Apocryphal example: beer and diapers
  + Can be used for any natural grouping
** Details :notes:
   + Example of how patterns are discovered is to look at groups of actions
   + One natural group is the shopping basket: what items are in it?
   + But can also be applied to anytime there is a natural grouping
     + Eg. web session logs group naturally around a person and time window

* Define "Frequently" :slide:
  + Action :: =A= and =B=
  + Support :: probability that a transaction contains =A ∪ B=
  + Confidence :: conditional probability that a transaction having =A= also
    contains =B=
** Probabilities :notes:
   + We have two actions =A= and =B=
   + Out of all the groupings, how many had both items?
   + Out of all the groupings with =A=, how many had =B=?

* Minimums :slide:two_col:
  + Min Support :: lower bound on support probability
  + Min Confidence :: lower bound on confidence probability
  + Strong :: Rule that satisfies both minimums

** "Frequently" :notes:
   + Now we can talk about what frequently means
   + It doesn't matter if two very unpopular items were purchased together: car
     battery and smoke detector
   + Also don't care if =A= happens a lot: everybody buys milk, so not a big
     deal if some bought milk and strawberries
   + Also important to note confidence is not symmetric: buying strawberries may be
     frequent with buying milk, but not visa versa

* Too Many Rules :slide:
  + Patterns not limited to 2 events
  + But looking for all patterns leads to combinatorial number of options
  | a,b,c,d,e |
  | a,b |
  | a,c |
  | ... |
  | a,b,c |
  | a,b,e |
  |...|

* Subset Patterns :slide:
  + Max-Pattern :: =X= rule is frequent and there exists no frequent
    super-pattern =Y=
  + Closed :: =X= rule is frequent and there exists no super-pattern =Y= *with the same support*
  + Shortcut :: Find only max-pattern or closed patterns, let other patterns be
    subsets
** Shortcut :notes:
   + So how can we calculate all the potentially frequently occurring patterns?
   + We can find either the max or closed pattern that encompasses all of the
     patterns we're looking for
   + These are more easily tracked, and we can still derive all of the
     frequently occurring sub-patterns
   + We can use the reverse: if a rule or item is not frequent enough alone, its
     super-set will not be frequent enough:
     + If =A= is does not meet min support, there's no way for =A,B= to make
       support

* Apriori :slide:
  1. Find supported single event rules
  1. Combine to make 2-event rules, check DB for support
  1. Combine to make 3-event rules, check DB...
  1. Stop when no N-event rules

** Speed :notes:
   + Isn't that slow? Yes!
   + Book has some techniques to speed it up, mostly around grouping
   + Can group together sets and if the group does not meet the support
     threshold, then none of the members do

* Interesting Patterns :slide:two_col:
  + Strong rules may not always be interesting rules
  + Basketball => eat cereal [40%, 66.7%] is strong
  + But "not cereal" has a bigger effect on if you play basketball
  | | Basketball | Not basketball | Sum |
  | Cereal | 2000 | 1750 | 3750 |
  | Not cereal | 1000 | 250 | 1250 |
  | Sum | 3000 | 2000 | 5000 |
** Details :notes:
   + Not cereal column: has a huge effect on if someone plays basketball
   + cereal + basketball... sure it happens frequently, but you'd actually
     expect to see a bigger effect

* Lift :slide:
  + =P(A ∪ B) / P(A)*P(B)=
  + If =A= and =B= independent, what is likelihood of =A= and =B=?
** Correlation :notes:
   + 1
   + so if lift > 1, you're seeing something that is happening more often than
     random
   + < 1 means they negatively correlated
   + X^2, cosine, others in book
