* Visualization in Data Mining :slide:

* Your Brain :slide:two_col:
  + Pattern detector
  + Visualizations help you search for possible models
  + Help intuitively understand the data
  [[file:img/memory-recall.png]]
** Visual :notes:
   + Most people, vision is the strongest sense
   + Recall improves 55% (10%=>65%) with addition of a picture
   + We've talked about the need to understand the data before using
     algorithms on it. Visualization can speed that process up.

* Patterns :slide:
  + Use visualizations that surface patterns and relationships
  + Know the context for the visualization
  + Verify results 
** Steps :notes:
   + For gaining intuition, focus on simple visualizations that help you see
     relationships in the data.
   + At this time, labels, titles, etc. not very important. Multiple dimension
     in multiple windows? Fine!
   + We'll discuss, but the context a visualization is going to be used in
     matters a lot. Don't feel like you have to import every cool infographic
     into your project
   + Clustering, classification, outlier selection can be verified visually, eg.
     highlighting points.  Use it to gut check conclusions, even if you have to
     drastically reduce dimensionality

* Scatter :slide:
  + Great for multidimensional data
  + Just plot > 2 dimensions in different plots
  + Reveals correlation, clustering, distribution, ...
** Data Mining :notes:
   + DM bread and butter. Often deal with high dimensionality, so scatter is one
     of the best ways to visualize
   + Wide variety of patterns can be searched

** Multiple Dimensions :slide:center:
   [[file:img/vp-sample.png]]
** vp :notes:
   + This data is for body positions over time
   + Dimensions are the different angles for different body parts, like hip
     ankle, knee, over time
   + We can see some strong patterns. Maybe we'll need to kernelize them to
     make them learnable, but we have a good understanding that there are, or
     are not relationships between the data

* Geographic :slide:
  [[file:img/cancer-county.jpg]]
** Trade-offs :notes:
  + Coordinates intuitively understandable
  + Lots of ways to bucket/aggregate
  + Dependence on geographical area (eg. when you'd like to depend
    on human impact instead)

* Other Chart Types :slide:
  + Box plot :: aggregate data
  + Bar charts :: simple summaries
  + Pie charts :: compound proportions
** Types :notes:
   + Box plots, for real data, still carry a lot of data
   + Bar charts nice for summarizing, not great for exploring
   + Same for pie charts. Pie charts are mostly bad, but can use in particular
     circumstances

* Aesthetics :slide:
  + The visual aesthetics you use should be tied to the data
  [[file:img/graphics-aesthetics.png]]
** Aesthetics :notes:
   + What are some of the techniques we can use to tie data to a visual
     representation?

** Larger Value? :slide:
   + Position
   + Length / Angle
   + Area / Volume
   + Color: Chroma Luminance
** Slide Switch :notes:
   + Hadley Wickham slides, OSCON

* Color: HCL :slide:two_col:
  + Hue :: color type, relative to RGBY
  + Chroma :: colorfulness, perceived color intensity
  + Luminosity :: brightness, light-dark
  [[file:img/Munsell.png]]
** Color Spaces :notes:
   + Many other color spaces, probably most familiar with RGB
   + HCL is useful because it separates the properties of a color into ones
     that can be mapped to data
   + Hue: nominal, can't compare
   + Chroma, Luminosity: numerical / comparable value
   + Chroma vs Saturation: chroma *perception* relative to white, saturation
     measure of color intensity
     + http://rourkevisualart.com/wordpress/2008/02/22/the-difference-between-chroma-and-saturation/

** ColorBrewer :slide:
   + http://colorbrewer2.org/
   + Type of comparison => type of color difference
   + Lots of other practical features

* Careful :slide:
  + Some aesthetics can combine to form illusions
  + http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/sze_sineIllusion/
** Line Lengths :notes:
   + Line lengths can appear to look smaller when extended instead of right
     next to each other

* Grammar of Graphics :slide:
  + Geom :: Graphic element
  + Aesthetics :: appearance of a geom
  + Data :: raw, context, statistical aggregations of data
  + Mapping :: functions which map data to geom properties or aesthetics
** Bringing Together :notes:
   + We've talked about different aesthetics of showing data, we've talked about
     data, all that's needed is to bring them together
   + Wilkinson, L. (2005), The Grammar of Graphics (2nd ed.). Statistics and Computing, New York: Springer.
   + Rigorous way of describing graphics beyond "scatter plot" or "bar chart"

* Scatter Plot :slide:animate:
  [[file:img/scatter-ice-cream.gif]]

  + Geoms?
    + points, tick marks
  + Data?
    + temperature, sales
  + Mapping?
    + sales -> y, temp -> x
    + Note, not a simple 1:1 mapping, we must map to something visual, like
      pixels
** Ice Cream :notes:
   + Plot shows hypothetical sales of ice cream vs temperature
   + Geoms: points (actually, ticks are geoms, too)
   + Data: sales, temperature (and context: how large is the potential plot
     size)
   + Mapping: sales
   + img: http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/scatter-xy-plots.html

* Bar Plot :slide:animate:
  [[file:img/bar-graph-fruit.gif]]

  + Geoms?
    + rectangles (ticks, text)
  + Data?
    + Fruit to popularity
  + Mapping?
    + popularity -> height, fruit type -> x, color
** Fruit :notes:
   + Plot shows fruit popularity
   + Geoms: bars (and ticket, text)
   + Data: 
   + Mapping: sales
   + img: http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/bar-graphs.html

* Hipmonk :slide:
  [[file:img/hipmonk.png]]

  + Geoms?
    + rectangles, text, ticks, 
  + Data?
    + Carrier, flight time, layover time, cost, wifi available, airports
  + Mapping?
    + travel time -> bar length, flight times -> sub-bars, "agony" -> y, airline -> color
** Fruit :notes:
   + Shows travel options from SFO to Ithica, connecting flights, airports, etc.
   + More complex, but still expressible via Grammar
   + img: http://www.hipmonk.com

* Recursive :slide:
  [[file:img/grammar-af.png]]

  + Geoms?
** Complex :notes:
   + Reading will go a further extension of this, where the geoms are themselves
     other plots

* Tufte :slide:
  + Clarity from data
  + Avoid chart junk
  + Techniques for displaying many types
  [[file:img/tufte-books.jpg]]
** Tufte :notes:
   + No talk on visualization would be complete without mentioning Tufte
   + Great examples
