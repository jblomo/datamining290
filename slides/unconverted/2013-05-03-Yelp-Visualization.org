* Visualizing Data at *Yelp* :slide:center:

* Visualizing Data is Important :slide:
  + Effectively summarizes data
  + Highlights patterns
  + Improves recall
** Metrics :notes:
   + Can't improve something till you measure
   + True, but have to look at and understand the data!
   + Often best way to understand data is visually
   + Having metrics you care about evident will make you focus on improving
     them
   + More sophisticated your visualizations, more sophisticated your goals

* Visualizing Data is Difficult :slide:
  + Requires investment
  + Dimensions of success
  + Successful visualizations in Yelp
** Role in Yelp :notes:
   + Often requires specific domain knowledge of both the data and the tools
   + Moving to a new office
   + Ideally have 2 big screens per pod
   + "That's a lot of TVs!"
   + Get motivated everyday
   + Show what you care about
   + Don't want a sterile office, decorate with the results of your work

#+END_HTML
** Review activity over time on a map :notes:
   + Written as part of Yelp's quarterly Hackathons
   + A lot of feedback from our Community Managers on understanding their city
   + Demonstrable value to advertisers
   + But main feature is... Cool

* Cool :slide:
  + Good looking is a dimension of any visualization
  + We want to be Neo or John Anderton, not Milton
[[file:img/minority-report-int2.jpg]]
** Cool is OK :notes:
   + Engineers need to come to grips that to be visually compelling, a visualization needs to look nice
   + Just like the most compelling novels need to be well written
   + We realize this, we just don't like to admit it

* Avoid Chart Junk :slide:two_col:
  + Edward Tufte rightfully suspicious of cool
  + Worry about =data/ink= ratio
  + But remember tradeoffs: memorability, fun
  [[file:img/usefuljunk-monster.jpg]]
** Useful Junk? :notes:
   + Data/ink ratio describes the amount of information displayed per ink/pixel
   + If you remove a pixel, will you remove information?
   + Best Paper by Scott Bateman HCI: some useful Junk
   + Noted the context of the chart
   + Bad ratio limits richness, especially important on mobile

#+END_HTML
** Shows errors live from log :notes:
   + Error activity
   + Highlight error type UnicodeDecodeError
   + Text details available
   + Still Cool!
     + Colors slick, modern
     + But used for differentiation (data)
** Grapperr Snapshot :slide:
[[file:img/graperr.png]]

* Actionable :slide:two_col:
  + Realtime*
  + Context
  + Connections
  [[file:img/dr-who.png]]
** Definitions :notes:
   + As realtime as problem domain requires
     + Seconds matter when fixing site problems, so should be up to the second
     + Days or weeks might matter when deciding budget issues
   + Context: Is this a normal amount of errors?
   + Connections: Ability to drill down to specific instance

* Dimensions :slide:
  + Fun :: cool, pretty, engaging
  + Actionable :: realtime, contextual, connecting
** Agenda :notes:
   + Dimensions important to visualizations
   + Axis on which you can evaluate them
   + Tradeoffs in developing them

* A Tale of Two Datacenters :slide:
  + Testing datacenter failover
  + Tracking metrics in a new way
  + Did we spend a week preparing a dashboard?
** How? :notes:
   + Yelp used to be in only one datacenter
   + Moving to two datacenters is a huge undertaking, but worth it for
     reliability reasons
   + Don't want to bring down a worldwide site when freak electrical storms hit your datacenter
   + After months of work, how did watch over our site when we finally flipped
     the switch?
   + This was the first time Yelp had done this: we didn't have a premade
     dashboard so everyone could track the important metrics

[[https://github.com/Yelp/firefly][Github: Yelp/firefly]]
** Demo :notes:
   + One of our many open source projects
   + Hosted on Github
   + Existing extension to Ganglia

* Easy :slide:
  + Make repeated operations fast and within reach
  + Must understand problem domain
  + Accessible
** Definitions :notes:
   + Sophisticated Tool: Data discovery, stacking options, coloring, layout
   + But all of the steps are repeated, formulaic: we're making similar things over and over
   + So make it easy!
   + Not much more accessible than Web: share links, etc.

* Easy from Simple :slide:
  + Avoid temptation to make visualizations easy from the start
  + Easy systems are designed for non-experts
  + Long term investment in the system to manage complexity
** Non-experts :notes:
   + Simple Made Easy, Rich Hickey
   + Still potentially technical users
   + Just don't know the details of how metrics are collected, or how to display
     across browsers
   + Always will require experts to make changes
   + Always are going to want new features
   + Make sure you have the ability to add them
   + Not extensible

* Search Maps :slide:
[[file:img/yelp-beer.png]]
Mo' Map
** Times Change :notes:
   + 2005, 8 years ago
   + May not seem like important visualization, but times have changed
   + Full page refresh for each map square
   + Now we take zoom in, panning for granted
   + Sign of a great visualization: don't think about it: it's a tool
   + What else are we not plotting on maps that we should be?

* Interactive :slide:two_col:
  + Fast
  + Explorable
  + Feedback
  [[file:img/yelp-mobile-map.png]]
** Definitions :notes:
   + Fast :: One of the reasons its a fairly recent technology, hard to get fast
     + Speed gives the UI illusion that you are interacting with a physical
       thing, something we're much more comfortable with
   + Explorable :: Multiple levels of detail that can be discovered by user
   + Feedback :: Update all other dependent displays (search results)

* Creation :slide:
  + Michael Bostock had a problem
  + Protovis useful, but not flexible
  + How to provide coherent description for visualizing data?
** D3 Intro :notes:
   + Mike Bostock professor at Stanford
   + Protivis was a declarative Javascript charting library
   + But hard to keep up with changes in technology
   + Wasn't quite flexible enough for new visualizations

* D3: Data-Driven Documents :slide:center:
#+BEGIN_HTML
<iframe src="http://bl.ocks.org/d/1256572/" style="width: 1000px;"></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/29862153">D3 Show Reel</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/mbostock">Mike Bostock</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
#+END_HTML

* Flexible :slide:
  + Language level
  + Access to medium
  + Access to data
#+begin_src javascript
d3.selectAll("p")
  .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
  .style("font-size",
    function(d) { return d + "px"; });
#+end_src
** Why? :notes:
   + Metaphor natural language
   + General language most flexible tool humans have to describe new things
   + Full access to medium to be able to create take advantage of all possibilities
     + and new tech
   + Not D3 specific, but need full data to find new ways to summarize, explore,
     drill
   + Need to understand where data came from to clean, normalize

* Dimensions :slide:
  + Fun :: cool, pretty, engaging
  + Actionable :: realtime, contextual, connecting
  + Easy :: available for non-experts, remove repetition
  + Interactive :: fast, explorable
  + Flexible :: expressive, full access to lowest level
** Tension :notes:
   + Obvious: Flexible vs Easy. Too many options is confusing.
   + Less obvious: Interactive vs Actionable. Spend too long playing, not enough fixing
   + In fact: All in contention for your time

* Understand Usage Context :slide:

** Press: Fun :slide:
[[file:img/yelp20m.jpg]]

** Alerting: Actionable :slide:
[[file:img/snoopy.png]]
** Search Metrics :notes:
   + This is a visualization of the status of our search cluster

** Product Managers: Easy :slide:
[[file:img/admin-metrics.png]]

** Investigation: Interactive :slide:
[[file:img/ipy_0.13.png]]
[[file:img/IPy_header.png]]

** Explorable: Interactive :slide:
[[file:img/maptivity.png]]
** Another Case :notes:
   + Another case for Interactivity is geographical data

** New tools: Simple :slide:
[[file:img/nvd3.png]]

** New tools: Flexible :slide:
[[file:img/tron-db.png]]
** Unique :notes:
   + You can see this is not a standard visualization
   + It is one that is customized to its purpose
   + Made possible by flexible tools

* Dimensions :slide:
  + Fun :: cool, pretty, engaging
  + Actionable :: realtime, contextual, connecting
  + Easy :: available for non-experts, remove repetition
  + Interactive :: fast, explorable
  + Flexible :: expressive, full access to lowest level
** Consider Tradeoffs :notes:
   + Visualization is just part of making an effective biz, team
   + Interested in working at Yelp?
