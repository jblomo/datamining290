## Nomenclature

### Record

a single entity or concept. Also: data object, sample, example,
instance, data point

### Feature

a characteristic or way of describing a record. Also: attribute,
dimension, variable, signal

???

## Slightly different from book

  + The meanings do carry different connotations, but are generally
    transferable
  + e.g., dimensions is usually used in the math domain
  + Feature is usually used in the ML domain

---

## Feautre Types

  + Binary: True/False. Also: 0/1
  + Numeric: Involving numbers. Also: integer, float, double
  + Ordinal: Feature with sortable values.
  + Discrete: countable, finite set. Also: classes
  + Continuous: unbounded numeric number. Also: integer, float, double
  + Enumerated: feature named, discrete values. Also: nominal, classed

???

## Rain data set

  + Stored did/dot not rain
  + Stored how many inches it rained
  + Stored the day as an integer offset from Jan 1 1970
  + Stored weather information: Sunny, Partly Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy
  + Stored barometer reading
  + Stored day of the week

---

## Central Tendency

<img src="img/skew-normal.png"/>

???

## Define

  + Mean: "average" all data points divided by size of set
  + Median: middle value
  + Mode: The value most likely to be picked
    + discrete: most common value
    + continuous: max probability density function

---

## Skew Positive

<img src="img/skew-positive.png" width=90%/>

???

## Skew

  + Think about ```mean - mode```
  + Or think about where the "tail" is

---

## Skew Negative

<img src="img/skew-negative.png" width=90%/>

---

## The Long Tail

  + Most popular are *very* popular
  + Everything else, not so much
  + But there's a lot of everything else

<img src="img/Long_tail.svg.png" width=100%/>

???

## Movies

  + Current releases: millions of people watching
  + Older movies are rented by < 1 person a week
  + What is the skew?
  + Power law distribution (please follow up on Wikipedia or a stats class)
  + Distributions are important, but will only be covered as necessary

---

*Todo: image assumes light background*

## Dispersion

  + Centrality not the whole story

<img src="img/dispersion.png" width=90%/>

???

## Differences

  + Wildly different data sets can still share many of these characteristics

---

*Todo: image assumes light background*

## Quartiles

<img src="img/quartiles.png" width=100%/>

???

## Parts

  + Go back to our unskewed normal distribution
  + Quartiles divide the data into quarters
  + InterQuartile Range is the distance of the middle two quartiles
  + BoxPlot is one of the most useful tools for data. For public results, I
    almost never want to see scatter plot or bar charts. I want to see box
    plots.
  + Bottom, we spit it up into standard deviations
  + Variance measures, on average, how far points are away from the mean
  + Standard deviation is the square root of the variance

---

*Todo: image assumes light background*

## Standard Deviation

  + Within 1: 68%
  + Within 2: 95%
  + Within 3: 99.7%

<img src="img/stddev.png" width=100%/>

???

## Standard Deviation

  + Useful for thinking about what % of outliers you'd like to catch
  + We use it for alerting: let us know when we're 2 stddev away from the
    median, there's a very small likelihood of that happening

---

## Visualization Tools

  + Python: Matplotlib
  + R: builtin
  + Matlab: builtin
  + Octave: builtin (gnuplot)
  + HTML: D3.js

???

## Covered later

  + Chapter 2 is going to cover some visualization stuff
  + We're going to cover visualization a bit later in the course, and more of a
    "how its done in industry"
  + There is another class on visualization in general

```

???

## Matrix

 + Matrix representations very powerful, as we'll see later in class
 + Usually rows are records, columns are attributes
 + Sometimes you can think of data in different ways, can take the transpose
   of the matrix to get attributes about movies

*Todo: waterworld?*

## Similarity | Distance

  + Two sides of the same coin
  + ```similarity = 1 - distance```
  + We'll use these metrics for many other algorithms

???

## Core Concept

  + Many data mining techniques rely on finding a way to quantify similarity
  + When you think about questions like "how similar are two users?" "is this
    text plagiarism?" "are these products likely to be purchased together?"
  + All are ways of thinking about similarity

---

## Nominal Distance

  + Ratio of mismatches to potential matches
  + Why can't we take the sum of the mismatches?

???

## Nominal

  + Nominal means we can't compare two values: there is no ordering
  + All we can do is take ratio of the ones that are exactly the same
  + The book describes how to think about this in terms of matrices

---

## Binary Distance

  + Could use Nominal Distance: count all exact matches or mismatches
  + Could use Numeric Distance: just treat values as 0/1
  + asymmetric binary dissimilarity: don't care about *negative matches*
    + ```mismatches / (positive_matches + mismatches)```
  + asymmetric binary similarity: care more about *positive matches* than mismatches
    + ```positive_matches / (positive_matches + mismatches)```

???

## Binary

  + Nominal problem: for rare attributes, like a disease, two people who
    *don't* have the disease, aren't necessarily very similar

---

## Jaccard Coefficient

  + Asymmetric binary similarity
  + More commonly used for calculating set similarity
  + ```|intersection| / |union|```
  + "Jimmy likes pizza" | "Shreyas likes pizza"

???

## Jaccard

  1. Break up into a set
  1. calculate # in intersection
  1. calculate # in union
  1. divide

## Euclidean distance

  + Straight line between two points
  + Again: usually considered with just (x,y), but can calculate for any number
    of dimensions

<img src="img/euclidean.png"/>

???

## Ordinary

  + Distance as you probably learned in grade school

---

*Todo: image assumes light background*

## Manhattan distance

  + How many blocks would you need to walk between two points?

<img src="img/manhattan.png"/>

???

## Usefulness
  + Obviously useful for maps/directions
  + But haven't seen it used much beyond that

---

*Todo: image assumes light background*

*Todo: math symbols*

## L_p norm

  + Euclidean distance and Manhattan can be generalized
  + Euclidean distance referred to as L_2 norm
  + Chebyshev distance is L_âˆž

<img src="img/lp-norm.png"/>

???

## L_p space

  + Important for signal processing, math, other applications
  + You may want to study these distances for comparing wave forms, like audio

---

## Ordinal Distance

  + Normalize the ordinal rankings
  + Use a numerical distance metric

---

## Cosine Similarity

  + Jaccard similarity can work well for sets of roughly equal size
  + How to compare sets with a large difference in magnitude?
  + Model them as vectors, take the cosign of the angle between

<img src="img/cosine-similarity.png" width=100%/>

???

## Cosine

  + Why cosine? Hint: normalization
  + img: http://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/0910/netflixprize/final_results/knn/index.html

## Cosine Example

  + "Jimmy likes pizza" | "Shreyas likes pizza"
