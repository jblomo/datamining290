## Classification: Decision Trees

---

## Types of Models

???

## Details

---

## Types of Models

  + Classifiers

???

## Details

  + Classifiers
    + describes and distinguishes cases. Yelp may want to find a category for
      a business based on the reviews and business description

---

## Types of Models

  + Classifiers
  + Regressions

???

## Details

  + Regressions
    + Predict a continuous value. e.g., predict a home's selling price given
      square footage and # of bedrooms

---

## Types of Models

  + Classifiers
  + Regressions
  + Clustering

???

## Details

  + Clustering
    + find "natural" groups of data *without labels*

---

## Types of Models

  + Classifiers
  + Regressions
  + Clustering
  + Outlier

???

## Details

   + Outlier
    + find anomalous transactions, e.g., finding fraud for credit cards

---

## Process

???

## Steps

  + to be able to classify data

---

## Process

  + Training Set

???

## Steps

  + Cleaned, preprocessed data that has labels. What are labels?

---

## Process

  + Training Set
  + Learning

???

## Steps

  + Feed the training set into an algorithm. Algorithm associates some of the
    features with the labels and generates a model.

---

## Process

  + Training Set
  + Learning
  + Model / Classifier

???

## Steps

  + Process or formula used to predict the label (class) given inputs (data
    records)

---

## Process

  + Training Set
  + Learning
  + Model / Classifier
  + Testing Set

???

## Steps

  + Data *not in training set*, with labels. Run through model to see how the
    model compares with the real labels.

---

## Process

  + Training Set
  + Learning
  + Model / Classifier
  + Testing Set
  + Verification / Accuracy

???

## Steps

  + Given the matches / mismatches in the testing set, how can we measure how
    well the model reflects reality?

---

## Process

  + Training Set
  + Learning
  + Model / Classifier
  + Testing Set
  + Verification / Accuracy
  + New Data

???

## Steps

  + Unseen Data
  + Finally, we're ready to start using our model / classifier to label new,
    real, unknown data! So clean and pre-process it the same way.

---

## Process

  + Training Set
  + Learning
  + Model / Classifier
  + Testing Set
  + Verification / Accuracy
  + New Data
  + Classification

???

## Steps

  + Feed in the unknown data and get out results!

---

## Learning

<img src="img/model.png" width=100% />

???

## Example

  + We have training data. What are these column types?
  + Feed it into a classification algorithm
  + In the case it is generating Rules.
  + Models can be as simple as this: just a set of rules to follow. We'll see
    how we can extend this idea
  + The learning step generates a model: these rules

---

## Classification

<img src="img/classifying.png" width=100% />

???

## Possibilities

  + Now that we have the model / classifier, we can do two things
  + 1: Use testing data *different* from training data
  + compare the classifier guesses with reality
  + 2: Use the classifier on unknown data
  + Why not just jump into classifying unknown data? Why have a test step?

---

## Machine Learning

  + Supervised
    + Given data with a label, predict data without a
      label
  + Unsupervised
    + Given data without labels, group "similar" items
      together
  + Semi-supervised
    + Mix of the above: eg. unsupervised to find groups,
      supervised to label and distinguish borderline cases
  + Active
    + Starting with unlabeled data, select the most helpful cases for a
      human to label

???

## Which is this?

  + In the example above, what type of learning?
  + Supervised: we have labels, we want to guess unlabeled data

---

## Confusion Matrix

  + What are the ways that classification can be wrong?

&nbsp;

|                  | Predict: Positive | Predict: Negative |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Actual: Positive | True Positive     | False Negative    |
| Actual: Negative | False Positive    | True Negative     |

???

## Basis for Evaluation

  + Most methods of evaluating results start with the confusion matrix
  + Figuring out what different ways you were right or wrong
  + Then using different formulas to emphasize the things you care about

---

## Recall & Precision

  + Recall: ```TP / P```
  + Precision: ```TP / (TP + FP)```
  + Sometimes these are in tension; other measurements balance them

???

## Trade-off

  + Classic trade-off in search

---

## Example: Search

<img src="img/burrito-search.png" width=100% />

???

## Searching Yelp

  + Searched yelp for a burrito in the Mission
  + How good are these search results?
  + Let's say we knew this first result was great, and *only* returned it
  + What would our precision be?
  + What would the recall be?
  + How could we improve recall?
  + How can we guarantee 100% recall?
  + What will that do to the precision?
  + Understand ways of combining these measurements in the book

---

## Decision Trees

  + Rules formulated as a tree of decisions
  + Choose Your Own Adventure for machine learning
  + So how do we build the trees?

???

## Rules expressed as trees

  + At each node in the tree, pose a question
  + Take a branch depending on your answer
  + Leaf nodes are labels

---

## Build a Tree

<img src="img/model.png" width=100% />

???

## Directions

  + First node question: is rank=professor?
  + If True, what's the label?
  + If False, we go to another node
  + Second node question: is years > 6?
  + If True what's the label?
  + If False, what's the label?

---

## Build a Tree

<img src="img/tree-dataset.png" width=100% />

???

## Next challenge

  + How to go from a data set like this

---

## Build a Tree

<img src="img/tree.png" width=100% />

???

## Result

  + To a tree like this?

---

## Decision Tree Induction

  + Start with all the data
  + Choose the "best" way to divide it up based on one attribute
  + Make a node that asks a question to split the data
  + Choose new "best" way to divide based on remaining attributes
  + Stop: no attributes left, all records are the same class

???

## Recursive

  + Look at all the attributes. What's the best way to split up the data?
  + We'll look at way to mathematically evaluate splits
  + Now recursively do the same
  + If you've split on all the attributes, but still have a mix, use a majority
    rule
  + If all the records are the same class, you don't have to keep spitting:
    your answer is right there!
  + For continuous data, must bucket it so you can have a discrete number of
    answers

---

## Information Gain

  + Comparison of how mixed results are before and after splitting
  + Entropy measurement of "mixed"
  + Two pure data sets have less entropy on average than one mixed

???

## Information

  + Book will go into detail about how to think about entropy
  + General idea: how difficult would it be to memorize the data sets?
  + Easy if pure: all class A
  + Still fairly easy if 2 pure sets: 1 is class A, other is class B
  + Now more difficult if they are mixed: first 2 records are A, then one B,
    then another A

---

## Gini Index

```python
  Gini(D) = 1 - sum(frac**2 for frac in classes)
```
  Sum of the squares of the fraction of items in each class

???

  + D is a given partitioning of the data

---

## Splitting

  + Discrete values can split per value
  + Or discrete values binary split into subsets
  + Continuous values can split on range (usually 2)

???

## Different

  + If you'd like a binary tree (useful for some algorithms), can split on
    subsets
  + Can't split 400 different ways on continuous values... what about values
    that haven't been seen before?

---

## Continuous Splitting

  + Test every split point to see which is best
  + Possible split points: midpoint between every adjacent value pair
  + Sort attribute, score midpoints

1
2
2
2
26
36
36
74
323
345
2234

???

## Review

  + What does best mean?
  + Can calculate with one pass through the data since you are just moving a
    few cases from one class to another

---

## Decision Tree Advantages

  + Models easy to understand and visualize
  + Can be faster to construct
  + Can encode tree in declarative languages (SQL)
  + Robust: outliers generally fit in with normal data

???

## Trees

  + Its a tree! Easy to draw
  + Greedy algorithm means you're only go over the data so many times
  + Models can translate into database statements
  + Outliers don't have a numeric pull on the data (similar to difference
    between median and mean)
