## Develop a Visualization

  + Learn D3
  + Extract data from your project
  + Build a visualization of it

---

## Deliverable

  + HTML with visualization
  + Dependencies

---

## Example

.tight-code[
```code/histogram.html```

```shell
# extract 2000 reviews
grep 'type": "review' yelp_academic_dataset_review.json | \
  head -n 200 > reviews-200.json
```

```python
import json
with open("reviews-200.json") as f:
    r = map(json.loads, f)
# extract star ratings
[rev['stars'] for rev in r]
```
]

???

## Notes

  + Include notes on how you extracted your data
  + Notes can be in a separate files, or comments in the code
  + My notes might be these shell/python commands

---

## Partners

  + If you've *never* written JS on your own:
    + Find someone familiar with D3
    + Still must turn in separate homeworks
    + Cite your sources

???

## Javascript

  + Since this class is not teaching Javascript, you'll need to learn on your
    own
  + Special case: find someone to help you *learn*
  + Folks who know D3: this assignment is not a challenge, so please find
    someone to help. Teaching is a great way to learn

---

## Extra Credit

  + [Vega](http://trifacta.github.io/vega/) is a JS visualization Grammer
  + Write homework in Vega instead

???

## Closer to Grammar

  + Vega is a declarative way of specifying a graphic
  + Uses D3 underneath
