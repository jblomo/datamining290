## Lab: Obtain and Explore Data

  + Setup GitHub account
  + Find a data set or external API
  + Superficially examine it
  + Summarize findings
  + Submit assignment via GitHub

---

## Why GitHub?

  + ```git``` tool is standard in industry
  + GitHub provides best tools for sharing, commenting code
  + This assignment will not have code, just practice submitting

---

## Setup GitHub account

  + Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free), making sure to
    use your .edu address
  + Use [GitHub/Edu](https://github.com/edu) to request a free micro plan:
    these let us use private accounts
  + Setup a [GitHub SSH Key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

---

## Setup git repository on ischool server

  + On the server ischool.berkeley.edu
```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/jretz/datamining290.git
```
  + On the server, in the datamining290 directory run
```bash
$ git remote rename origin jretz
```

---

## Connect it to GitHub

  + After you receive your free micro account on GitHub, create a private repository called datamining290
  + It will provide you with an SSH git path, let's call it PATH
  + You must use the *SSH* PATH starting with ```git://```
  + On the server, in the datamining290 directory, run
```bash
$ git remote add origin PATH
$ git push origin master
```

---

## Share with us

  + Hopefully you now have a private copy of my repository
  + Add Shreyas and me (users: seekshreyas, jretz) as a contributor to your private repository

---

## Obtain Data

  + Look through the links in slides for interesting data sets, or find your own
  + Or find a service API, like NYTimes
  + Explore the data available to answer the following questions

---

## Questions

  + What are the types of data available to you?
  + For data sets: how many records are in the data set?
  + For API: what are the limits on fetching data?
  + Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is
    interesting
  + What are 3 questions you could answer using your data?

---

## Submit Homework

  + On the ischool server, create a branch called ```hw-obtain-data```
  + Create a text file to write the solution, a simple editor to use is ```pico```
  + ```git add``` the file
  + ```git commit``` the change
  + ```git push origin hw-obtain-data``` to put it on GitHub
  + On github, submit a "pull request" from the ```hw-obtain-data``` branch to your master branch

???

## Pull Requests

   + Pull requests are a way of showing updates in a way that lets me provide
     comments, get notifications

---

## Going Forward

  + Other homework assignments will be completing code
  + General work-flow:
    + Start a new branch
    + Add required files
    + Push to GitHub
    + Submit Pull Request
