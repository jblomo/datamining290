# Data Mining 290T-03
## Jimmy Retzlaff & Shreyas

---

## Course Goals
  + Extract *information* from *data*
  + Understand techniques to find patterns
  + Apply algorithms to real data sets

---

## We'll Do Stuff
  + 30%: 10 Homework Assignments
  + 30%: 1 Midterm
  + 40%: 1 Project: Find, Mine, Report on Data

???

## Homework Details
  + Homework due at midnight Wednesday before class
  + Each 24 hours late is 10% off
  + Homework will be turned in by GitHub pull request
  + Project will be submitted by email & presentation

---

## But Don't Worry
  + This isn't a programming class
  + Grades are based on understanding of the concepts, not the craziest project
  + Shreyas & I are here to help

???

## Help
  + We realize there's a wide range of technical skill
  + We will help get anyone up to speed in these technical areas

---

## This is a Graduate Course
  + Perform well without supervision
  + Readings from both book and online documentation
  + TMTOWTDI
  + Getting frameworks working on your computer

???

## Style
  + More fire hose than spoon fed, you'll need to follow up for understanding
  + Honor system: No copying code or answers. Helping each other with
    concepts is encouraged, but document it.
  + Everybody has a different work flow.  We'll be covering the most basic.
    Great if you want to do something different, but realize we may not be
    able to help you as much.
  + Non ISchool students should email student ID from EDU account to shreyas
    and jretz and we will get you an ischool accounts.
  + You may want to use other frameworks for your projects. Great! But again,
    we may not be familiar with them.

---

## Prerequisites
  + Basic probability: P(A), P(A or B), P(A and B), P(A | B)
  + Basic programming: Python
  + Basic command line: SSH, downloading, copying large files, running programs
    against data
  + Textbook: Han, J., Kamber, M., & Pei, J. (2011). _Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques_, Third Edition *(3rd ed.)*. Morgan Kaufmann.
  + Technology will be available on ```ischool.berkeley.edu```

???

## Basics
  + "Probability of A", "Probability of A or B" "A and B" "A given B"
  + Most assignments filling in algorithm code
  + Project you may use any language, though we suggest Python.
  + We'll introduce any specific frameworks
  + Command line: cp, mv, less... Imagine you have a 10GB file, how are you
    going to inspect the contents?

---

## Material
  + Process: from finding data to mining it to visualizing results
  + Algorithms: all intuitively motivated, some rigorously studied
  + Programming: using algorithms against data sets
  + Discovery: finding information in a self-defined project

???

## What will we learn?
  + Data mining is not just about algorithms. We'll learn how to obtain, clean,
    and store data.
  + In real life, this is 70% of the job!
  + We'll cover many different algorithms, and dive deep on several of
    them. But we're not going to get into any hairy math proofs.
  + Programming is the best way to precisely describe an algorithm. It is also
    the way data mining is used in the real world.
  + Your own project should emphasize your passion. Again, the real world requires
    you to grab data and squeeze information out of it without external help.

---

## Lectures & Labs
  + Start with Q&A for at least 10 minutes
  + Expect to be asked a question
  + Breaks
  + Lab: Stick around and get the first question of homework done
  + Slides on http://jretz.github.io/datamining290/
  + Source for everything on https://github.com/jretz/datamining290/

???

## Helpful tips
  + Helpful to me if you say your name
  + Sorry, I tend to forget names
  + If I am not calling on you, check to make sure you are on the class list!
  + I'm not taking attendance, but let me know if you can't make it so I
    won't call on you

---

## Office Hours
  + We'll stay after class
  + or schedule a Skype call
  + [Piazza](https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2014/info290t03/home) for
    questions and announcements
  + Wait list will be processed normally until 3rd week... then I'll accept
    everyone who's participated in class if we have physical room

## Data is Important
  + Making decisions is a core part of humanity
  + Data can help you make better decisions
  + Challenge: extract information from data to improve decisions

???

## Decisions
  + From big to small; from planning to execution
  + Business questions: what is the ROI of this feature? Where to concentrate
    development?
  + Personal questions: Where to eat dinner tonight? What movie to see?
  + Improving decisions means improving quality of life

## Nice example of data mining
  + Stop at 3:51
  + Had to work with external parties to get data (Yelp, city of Seattle)
  + Had to clean data (literally, sometimes he was just handed paper receipts)
  + Used regression analysis to discover patterns
  + created follow up questions
  + Used result to understand the meaning behind the data

---

## Data Mining ecosystem
  + Data mining is part of a process to make decisions from data
  + Intersection between statistics, computer science, data management, and
    machine learning
  + Analysis & visualization often required

???

## Ecosystem
  + We'll talk about several ways to think about the process from data to
    knowledge
  + No universally agreed process, or black-and-white boundaries
  + Analysis: used at the beginning of investigations to understand data
    characteristics
  + Visualization: better understanding of the results of analysis or data
    mining

---

## Analysis vs. Data Mining

### Analysis
  + Manually investigating data. No algorithms.
  + Statistical qualities: mean, median, standard deviation
  + Histograms (manually set buckets)
  + Counts / Percentages

### Data Mining
  + Discovering patterns though automated algorithms
  + Regressions: fitting data to a model
  + Clustering: grouping data without manually set descriptions
  + Classification: identifying divisive features

???

## Pedantic

  + Difference is subtle, but important for both the project and your resume

---

## Machine Learning

  + Programs that can learn from data
  + Focus on prediction, based on verified training data
  + Used in two ways: during Data Mining and after Data Mining

[![Robot reading](http://distillery.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2011/06/15/04cfeacce2f4404483d96a4428f9adbd_7.jpg)](http://photopile.me/user/hartanta/?max_id=100596871_2487764#)

???

## Uses

  + During - assume we have training data, train on it, see how useful trained
    program is or find outliers
  + After - Discover clusters, verify and label clusters. Use labeled clusters
    to train a program to recognize new data points

---

## Probability & Statistics

  + Data describes real world events
  + Probability can describe real world *expected* events
  + Distributions can be used to summarize data, understand the factors behind
    its creation

<center><img src="img/Poisson_cdf.svg.png" width=60% /></center>

???

## Uses

  + Can "fit" data to a distribution, find outliers that are unexpected
  + An example: Poisson distribution describes the expectation of a particular
    number of events occurring.
    + e.g., pieces of mail. Average is 4, but it can vary. Is getting 7 or more
      pieces of mail really an outlier?

---

## Process

### [Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process)
  + Selection
  + Pre-processing
  + Transformation
  + Data Mining
  + Interpretation/Evaluation

### [Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Industry_Standard_Process_for_Data_Mining)
  + Business Understanding
  + Data Understanding
  + Data Preparation
  + Modeling
  + Evaluation
  + Deployment

???

## Common Themes
   + Figure out what you want to do
   + Get the data
   + Make sure it's OK
   + Understanding
   + Make a decision, test its effectiveness
   + Reading will cover another process, aimed at "Data Science", but basically
     applies to Data Mining
