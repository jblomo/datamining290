# Visualization in Data Mining

---

# Your Brain two_col:

  + Pattern detector
  + Visualizations help you search for possible models
  + Help intuitively understand the data
  <img src="img/memory-recall.png"/>

???

## Visual

  + Most people, vision is the strongest sense
  + Recall improves 55% (10%=>65%) with addition of a picture
  + We've talked about the need to understand the data before using
    algorithms on it. Visualization can speed that process up.

---

# Patterns

  + Use visualizations that surface patterns and relationships
  + Know the context for the visualization
  + Verify results

???

## Steps

  + For gaining intuition, focus on simple visualizations that help you see
    relationships in the data.
  + At this time, labels, titles, etc. not very important. Multiple dimension
    in multiple windows? Fine!
  + We'll discuss, but the context a visualization is going to be used in
    matters a lot. Don't feel like you have to import every cool infographic
    into your project
  + Clustering, classification, outlier selection can be verified visually, eg.
    highlighting points.  Use it to gut check conclusions, even if you have to
    drastically reduce dimensionality

---

# Scatter

  + Great for multidimensional data
  + Just plot > 2 dimensions in different plots
  + Reveals correlation, clustering, distribution, ...

???

## Data Mining

  + DM bread and butter. Often deal with high dimensionality, so scatter is one
    of the best ways to visualize
  + Wide variety of patterns can be searched

---

## Multiple Dimensions center:

  <img src="img/vp-sample.png"/>

???

## vp

  + This data is for body positions over time
  + Dimensions are the different angles for different body parts, like hip
    ankle, knee, over time
  + We can see some strong patterns. Maybe we'll need to kernelize them to
    make them learnable, but we have a good understanding that there are, or
    are not relationships between the data

---

# Geographic

  <img src="img/cancer-county.jpg"/>

???

## Trade-offs

  + Coordinates intuitively understandable
  + Lots of ways to bucket/aggregate
  + Dependence on geographical area (eg. when you'd like to depend
    on human impact instead)

---

# Other Chart Types

  + Box plot: aggregate data
  + Bar charts: simple summaries
  + Pie charts: compound proportions

???

## Types

  + Box plots, for real data, still carry a lot of data
  + Bar charts nice for summarizing, not great for exploring
  + Same for pie charts. Pie charts are mostly bad, but can use in particular
    circumstances

---

# Aesthetics

  + The visual aesthetics you use should be tied to the data
  <img src="img/graphics-aesthetics.png"/>

???

## Aesthetics

  + What are some of the techniques we can use to tie data to a visual
    representation?
  + img: Kevin Lynagh, http://keminglabs.com/talks/

---

## Larger Value?

  + Position
  + Length / Angle
  + Area / Volume
  + Color: Chroma Luminance

???

## Slide Switch

  + Hadley Wickham slides, OSCON

---

# Color: HCL two_col:

  + Hue: color type, relative to RGBY
  + Chroma: colorfulness, perceived color intensity
  + Luminosity: brightness, light-dark
  <img src="img/Munsell.png"/>

???

## Color Spaces

  + Many other color spaces, probably most familiar with RGB
  + HCL is useful because it separates the properties of a color into ones
    that can be mapped to data
  + Hue: nominal, can't compare
  + Chroma, Luminosity: numerical / comparable value
  + Chroma vs Saturation: chroma *perception* relative to white, saturation
    measure of color intensity
    + http://rourkevisualart.com/wordpress/2008/02/22/the-difference-between-chroma-and-saturation/

---

## ColorBrewer

  + http://colorbrewer2.org/
  + Type of comparison => type of color difference
  + Lots of other practical features

---

# Careful

  + Some aesthetics can combine to form illusions
  + http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/sze_sineIllusion/

???

## Line Lengths

  + Line lengths can appear to look smaller when extended instead of right
    next to each other

---

# Grammar of Graphics

  + Geom: Graphic element
  + Aesthetics: appearance of a geom
  + Data: raw, context, statistical aggregations of data
  + Mapping: functions which map data to geom properties or aesthetics

???

## Bringing Together

  + We've talked about different aesthetics of showing data, we've talked about
    data, all that's needed is to bring them together
  + Wilkinson, L. (2005), The Grammar of Graphics (2nd ed.). Statistics and Computing, New York: Springer.
  + Rigorous way of describing graphics beyond "scatter plot" or "bar chart"

---

# Scatter Plot animate:

  <img src="img/scatter-ice-cream.gif"/>

  + Geoms?
    + points, tick marks
  + Data?
    + temperature, sales
  + Mapping?
    + sales -> y, temp -> x
    + Note, not a simple 1:1 mapping, we must map to something visual, like
      pixels

???

## Ice Cream

  + Plot shows hypothetical sales of ice cream vs temperature
  + Geoms: points (actually, ticks are geoms, too)
  + Data: sales, temperature (and context: how large is the potential plot
    size)
  + Mapping: sales
  + img: http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/scatter-xy-plots.html

---

# Bar Plot animate:

  <img src="img/bar-graph-fruit.gif"/>

  + Geoms?
    + rectangles (ticks, text)
  + Data?
    + Fruit to popularity
  + Mapping?
    + popularity -> height, fruit type -> x, color

???

## Fruit

  + Plot shows fruit popularity
  + Geoms: bars (and ticket, text)
  + Data:
  + Mapping: sales
  + img: http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/bar-graphs.html

---

# Hipmonk

  <img src="img/hipmonk.png"/>

  + Geoms?
    + rectangles, text, ticks,
  + Data?
    + Carrier, flight time, layover time, cost, wifi available, airports
  + Mapping?
    + travel time -> bar length, flight times -> sub-bars, "agony" -> y, airline -> color

???

## Fruit

  + Shows travel options from SFO to Ithica, connecting flights, airports, etc.
  + More complex, but still expressible via Grammar
  + img: http://www.hipmonk.com

---

# Recursive

  <img src="img/grammar-af.png"/>

  + Geoms?

???

## Complex

  + Reading will go a further extension of this, where the geoms are themselves
    other plots

---

# Tufte

  + Clarity from data
  + Avoid chart junk
  + Techniques for displaying many types
  <img src="img/tufte-books.jpg"/>

???

## Tufte

  + No talk on visualization would be complete without mentioning Tufte
  + Great examples
