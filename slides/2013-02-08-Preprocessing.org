* Preprocessing :slide:

* Real World is Dirty :slide:
  + Incomplete :: missing timestamps for actions
  + Noisy :: salary = -10
  + Inconsistent :: age: 42, birthday: 1997-03-07
** Types of dirty :notes:
   + Incomplete :: lacking some attribute values, containing only aggregate
     data. Eg. We often regret not including timestamps on different actions
     like UFCing, instead of tracking total votes (aggregation)
   + Noisy :: Containing errors, like impossible salary data, or decimals in the
     wrong place
   + Inconsistent :: If there's every two fields that depend on each other, in a
     large dataset you'll find them disagreeing. Errors ofen come from failures:
     processes failing halfway into updating

* Causes of Problems :slide:
  + Humans
  + Software
  + Hardware
** Problems :notes:
   + Berkeley experiment to measure temperature across campus
   + Turned out average on campus much warmer than external weather services
     predicted
   + But sample data looked in line with predictions
   + Problem: one monitoring station right next to air conditioning unit!
   + Hardware failure rare, but with large numbers of machines, probable.  Eg.
     RAM can suffer ~1 bit/hour/gigabyte (ECC can help)

** Inconsistent Different Sources :slide:
   + Great value in combining data sources
   + Challenge is merging them together, removing duplicates
   + Example: Business names
** Business names :notes:
   + Starbucks vs. Starbucks Coffee Shop
   + Buck's vs Bucks
   + Trying to use address? Stackbucks vs. Starbucks across the street
   + Best strategy here is to use DM/ML techniques on the *combination* of
     features to determine likelihood of match. We'll discuss specific
     algorithms later in the course

* Preprocessing :slide:
  + Cleaning :: fill missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove
    outliers, resolve inconsistencies
  + Integration :: merging data from multiple sources
  + Reduction :: obtain a smaller data set that can sufficiently answer
    important questions
  + Transformation :: change data to a form that is easier to mine or analyze
** Flu Trend Problems (Questions) :notes:
   + We have millisecond search resolution, but will only be plotting on a per day basis
   + We have the exact text of each query, but just care if it is about the flu or not
   + Flu Trends, we sometimes see out of control search bots doing 100,000s of searches per day
   + Mobile phone searches and web searches hit different machines, software, logs
   + We have IPs in the logs, but will by plotting against geographical areas

* Missing Values :slide:two_col:
Class Height
| Jim | 6'0 |
| Ashley | - |
| Sam | 5'11 |
| Alice | 5'9 |
| Kate | - |

[[file:tallest-shortest-man.jpg]]
** What to do? :notes:
   + (Heights are made up)
   + We want to get an average class height
   + Q: What to do with missing rows?
   + ignore, fill, constant, average, average wrt gender

* Fill Missing Values :slide:animate:
  + Ignore the record
  + Find value manually
  + Global constant
  + Average
  + Average with respect to class
  + "Most probable"
** Details :notes:
   + Trade-offs :: core to engineering
   + Ignore ::  simply drop from data set. Hope there are not too many to affect
     answer. Drawbacks? When missing values are all same class (skew data)
  + Find value manually :: Even for a small class, might be difficult. Get
    ruler, measure them. For historical data, impossible.
  + Global constant :: replace with "N/A" or "6 foot". Can skew data, or cause
    data to pop in other analysis (all grouped together)
  + Average :: Mean or median.  Either one has potential problems.
  + Average with respect to class :: gender. Average female/male height to fill
    in values
  + "Most probable" :: Think of as another step from avg -> class avg.  Now
    throw in other details: age, family history, shoe size. Then weight
    depending on how much those factors are correlated.  Pretty soon you have a
    regression or Bayesian model, which will cover later

* Normalization :slide:
  + Type of data transformation to make reasoning and comparison easier
  + Is 6' tall?
  + Coefficients on attributes in regressions understandable
** Context, Comparison :notes:
   + 6' Might be tall for this class, but not on a basketball team
   + How to know when a data point "average" or towards the top of a range?
   + For our housing model, we wanted to use sq. footage and # of bedrooms. But
     the sq. footage number is huge compared to bedrooms.  If we didn't
     normalize, a formula for determine house price might seem to indicate that
     # of bedrooms was way more important

* Min-max :slide:
[[file:img/min-max.gif]]
** New Range :notes:
   + Typically new range is
     + [0-1] (thought of as %)
     + [-1-1] (though of as bad->good

* Z-score :slide:
[[file:img/z-score.gif]]
** Uses :notes:
   + When you want a relative measure of deviation
   + When you have a distribution estimate, but are unsure of absolute min-max

* Comparison :slide:
[[file:outliers.png]]
[[file:outliers-minmax-zscore.png]]
** Min-max vs Z-score :notes:
   + Min-max: Known range
   + Z-score: more expressive range
   + Min-max: requires knowing min-max
   + Z-score: can estimate with sampling or informed guess

* Removing Noise :slide:
  + Binning :: create B bins << N data samples, use aggregate statistic of bin
    for value
  + Regression :: fit data to a function, use function value
  + Outlier analysis :: find outlying points, understand and/or ignore them
** Monitoring Problem :notes:
   + For the problem encountered in temperature monitoring, which makes the most
     sense?

** Trade-offs :slide:
   + Binning :: Simple way to remove outliers, but difficult to pick buckets
     correctly
   + Regression :: If one metric is a direct function of another, what extra
     information does the value provide?
   + Outlier analysis :: Manual process of understanding outliers, ignoring them
     can obscure some analysis (eg. income disparity)
*** Trade-offs again :notes:
    + Remember: this class is exposing you to potential tools, up to you to be
      asking the right questions, selecting the appropriate algorithms,
      interpreting results

* Data integration :slide:
  + Merging two data sources
  + Problem: uniquely identify a concept in both sources
  + Find data points that are very "close" to each other, call them the same
    with some probability
  + Example: [[http://www.yelp.com/menu/tartine-bakery-san-francisco][Yelp Menu Data]]
** Yelp Menu Data :notes:
   + Recently launched menu data
   + Takes data about the restaurant menu, find reviews & pictures referring to
     the menu item
   + Joins them together
   + Many different metrics for "close": remember them?

* Other measures of "close" :slide:
Are =A= and =B= close?
| A | B |
| 2 | 60 |
| 5 | 150 |
| 6 | 180 |
| 10 | 300 |
| 13 | 390 |
** Correlation :notes:
  + Imagine =A= and =B= have several different dimensions, maybe things like
    length, height, width, radius
  + Are they similar?
  + On one hand no: clearly different order of magnitude
  + Another way to think about similarity is correlation
  + All of =B= dimensions are 30x of =A=
  + Maybe just using different units!
  + If I plotted =A= and =B= and x,y, what would the result look like?

* Χ^2 Correlation Test :slide:
  [[file:img/correlation.png]]
  [[file:img/chiequation.jpg]]
** Motivation :notes:
   + Answer: a straight line
   + So a correlation coefficient gives a sense of how closely *linearly*
     related two data sets are
   + Note, besides positive & negative, the slop does not affect the correlation
     score, just how well fit the data is
   + Also note I said linear: patterns may still be exhibited, but they are not
     linearly related, eg 30x
   + Details of test are in book, you are expected to understand it
   + Motivation: how different are the observed values from the expected?
   + Expected is calculated using probability with the assumptions that the sets
     are *independent*

* Covariance & Correlation :slide:
  + Correlation is "normalized" covariance
  + Covariance describes the degree to which two data sets track each other in
    units of of the two data sets
  + Correlations describes the degree of similarity without units
** Use in industry :notes:
   + Χ^2 used most commonly, handy to have an expected [0-1] range
   + "Correlation does not imply causation"
   + A->B, B->A, C->A,B, A->B->A..., coincidence

* Data Reduction :slide:two_col:
  + Dimensionality :: remove attributes that are the same or similar to other
    attributes
  + Numerosity :: represent or aggregate the data, sometimes with precision loss
  + Compression :: generalized techniques to decrease the number of bytes needed
    to store data
[[file:compress-car.jpg]]
** Deep Dive :notes:
   + We're only going to cover selected topics in these areas.
   + When reading, make sure to understand the intuition behind the other
     techniques, but if we don't cover it in lecture, you won't need to
     calculate it in midterm
   + Ask questions about the concepts you don't understand! That's what
     separates this class from a book :)
   + But still potentially useful for your projects!
   + img: http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcovdz/4520986339/sizes/o/in/photostream/

* Subset Selection :slide:
  + Two many attributes?
  + *Ignore some*
  + Tricky part: which to ignore?
  + height x width = area
** Simple to Sophisticated :notes:
   + Ignore the ones that are not helpful
   + Ignore an attribute highly correlated with another (cm, in)
   + Ignore an attribute that can be built from others

* Principal Component Analysis :slide:
[[file:GaussianScatterPCA.png]]
  + Map data to a locatoin along a few vectors
** Higher dimensions :notes:
   + Remember, 2 dimensions might not make much sense, but becomes useful in
     higher number of dimensions
   + These points described by two attributes, <x,y>
   + What if we wanted to describe them in just 1 dimension?
   + Pick some good vectors (in our case 1)
   + Describe where a point is located using only those vectors

* Netflix and PCA :slide:
  + A user may have many preferences: Mission Impossible, Love Actually, Man
    from Nowhere, ...
  + Instead of keeping track of every preference, we can summarize
  + Action, RomCom, Foreign
** Summarize in discovered dimensions :notes:
   + With 3 or more "categories", we can reconstruct the user's likely
     preferences
   + Dimensions don't necessarily fit into human notions: probably is not an
     "foreign" dimension, but a subtle combination of other aspects
