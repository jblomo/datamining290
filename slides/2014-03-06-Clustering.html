# Clustering

---

## Types of Models

  + Classifiers
  + Regressions
  + *Clustering*
  + Outlier

???

## Details

  + Classifiers
    + describes and distinguishes cases. Yelp may want to find a
    category for a business based on the reviews and business description
  + Regressions
    + Predict a continuous value. Eg. predict a home's selling
    price given sq footage, # of bedrooms
  + Clustering
    + find "natural" groups of data *without labels*
  + Outlier
    + find anomalous transactions, eg. finding fraud for credit cards

---

## Clustering

  + Group together similar items
  + Separate dissimilar items
  + Automatically discover groups without providing labels

???

## Perspectives

  + Similar items: again, metrics of similarity critical in defining these
    groups
  + Marking boundaries between different classes
  + Type of groups unknown before hand. Out of many attributes, what tend to be
    shared?

---

## Machine Learning

  + Supervised
  + Unsupervised
  + Semi-supervised
  + Active

???

## Definitions

  + Supervised
    + Given data with a label, predict data without a
    label
  + Unsupervised
    + Given data without labels, group "similar" items
    together
  + Semi-supervised
    + Mix of the above: e.g., unsupervised to find groups,
    supervised to label and distinguish borderline cases
  + Active
    + Starting with unlabeled data, select the most helpful cases for a
    human to label

---

## Clustering Applications

  + Gain insight into how data is distributed
  + Preprocessing step to bootstrap labeling
  + Discover outliers

???

## Apps

  + Closest we have to "magic box": put structured data in, see what groups may
    exist
  + You want labeled data, but where to start?  How many classes? What to name
    them?
    + Cluster data, investigate examples.
    + Hand label exemplary cases
    + Choose names that distinguish groups
    + Run classifier on labeled data, compare with clustering, examine errors,
      repeat

---

## Yelp Examples

  + User groups based on usage, reviewing habits, feature adoption
  + Businesses: when should a new category be created, what should it be called?
  + Reviews: for a particular business, are there common themes. Show better
    variety?

???

## Examples

  + User groups may be trend spotters, "lurkers", travelers, early adopters
  + Do we need a New American and American category? How similar are these
    categories?
  + Does a reviewer need to read 10 reviews about great food, so-so service?
    Maybe providing different view points helps give a better picture

---

## Intuition

  + Intuition => Mathematical Expression => Solution => Evaluation
  + High intra-class similarity
  + Low inter-class similarity
  + Interpretable

???

## Good Clusters

  + Just like all data mining, needs to be used to take action
  + Can't take action if you don't understand the results
  + Trade-offs: testing shows it works, but you don't understand it

---

## Methods

  + Partitioning
    + Construct ```k``` groups, evaluate fitness, improve groups
  + Hierarchical
    + Agglomerate items into groups, creating "bottom-up" clusters; or divide set into ever smaller groups, creating "top-down" clusters
  + Density
    + Find groups by examining continuous density within a potential
    group
  + Grid
    + Chunk space into units, cluster units instead of individual records

???

## Algorithms

  + Partitioning
    + Method similar to gradient descent: find some grouping,
    evaluate it, improve it somehow, repeat. k-means.
  + Hierarchical
    + Build groups 1 "join" at a time, examining distance between
    two things that can be joined together, if close, combine groups. Reverse:
    divisive.
  + Density
    + Many of the above methods just look for distance.  This method
    tries to find groups that might be strung out, but maintain a density.  Think
    about an asteroid belt.  It is one group, but not clustered together in a way
    you typically think.
  + Grid
    + Can speed up clustering and provide similar results

---

## k-means

  + Start: Randomly pick =k= centers for clusters
  + Repeat:
    + Assign all other points to their closest cluster
    + Recalculate the center of the cluster

???

## Iterative

  + Start at a random point, find step in right direction, take step,
    re-evaluate

---

## Example

<img src="img/kmeansclustering.jpg"/>

???

## Process

  + We pick some nodes at random, mark with a cross
  + Find other points that are closest to the crosses
  + Find new *centroid* based on the average of all points
  + Start again
  + img: http://apandre.wordpress.com/visible-data/cluster-analysis/

---

## Distance

  + *Centroid* is the average of all points in a cluster; the center
  + Different distance metrics for real numbers
  + But how to find "average" of binary or nominal data?

???

## You Can't

  + k-means is used for numerical data

---

## Normalization

  + Cluster cities by average temperature and population attributes
  + <x,y> = <temp, pop>
  + Using Euclidean distance, which attribute will affect similarity more?

???

## Un-normalized

  + Population: it is a much bigger number, will contribute much more to
    distance
  + Artificially inflating importance just because units are different

---

## Normalization Techniques

  + Z-score
    + ```(v - mean) / stddev```
  + Min-max
    + ```(v - min) / (max - min)```
  + Decimal
    + ```* 10``` ```/ 10```
  + Square
    + ```x**2```
  + Log
    + ```log(x)```

???

## Useful for?

  + Z-score
    + 1-pass normalization, retaining information about stdev
  + Min-max
    + keep within expected range, usually [0-1]
  + Decimal
    + easy to apply
  + Square
    + keep inputs positive
  + Log
    + de-emphasize differences between large numbers

---

## Local Optima

<img src="img/k-means-local.png"/>

???

## No Guarantee

  + Since there are many possible stable centers, we may not end up at the best
    one
  + How can we improve our odds of finding a good separation?
    + Why did we end up here? starting points
    + Choose different starting points
    + Compare results
  + Other problems? Mouse

---

## Uneven Groups

<img src="img/k-means-mouse.png"/>

???

## k-means

  + k-means is good for similarly sized groups, or at least groups that are
    similar distance between other members
  + Other problems that would pull the centroid away from the real groups?
  + Outliers
  + img: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering

---

## Medoids

  + Instead of finding a *centroid* find a *medoid*
  + Medoid: actual data point that represents median of the cluster
  + PAM: Partitioning Around Medoids

???

## Trade-offs

  + PAM more expensive to evaluate
  + Scales poorly, since we need to evaluate many more medoids with many more
    points

---

## Example

<img src="img/k-medoids.png"/>

???

## Stability

  + No stability between real clusters
  + Outliers can't pull centroid far out of actual cluster
  + img: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids

---

# *Break*

<img src="img/screenshot_metroid2.jpg"/>

  + Do not confuse Medoid with Metroid

???
