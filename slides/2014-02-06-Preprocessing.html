# Preprocessing

## Real World is Dirty

### Incomplete
missing timestamps for actions

### Noisy
salary = -10

### Inconsistent
age: 42, birthday: 1997-03-07

???

## Types of dirty

### Incomplete
lacking some attribute values, containing only aggregate data.
e.g., We often regret not including timestamps on different actions
like UFCing, instead of tracking total votes (aggregation)

### Noisy
Containing errors, like impossible salary data, or decimals in the
wrong place

### Inconsistent
If two fields depend on each other in a large dataset, you'll find them
disagreeing. Errors often come from failures: processes failing halfway
into updating

---

## Causes of Problems

  + Humans
  + Software
  + Hardware

???

## Problems

  + Berkeley experiment to measure temperature across campus
  + Turned out average on campus much warmer than external weather services
    predicted
  + But sample data looked in line with predictions
  + Problem: one monitoring station right next to air conditioning unit!
  + Hardware failure rare, but with large numbers of machines, probable.  e.g.,
    RAM can suffer ~1 bit/hour/gigabyte (ECC can help)

---

## Inconsistent Different Sources

  + Great value in combining data sources
  + Challenge is merging them together, removing duplicates
  + Example: Business names

???

## Business names

  + Starbucks vs. Starbucks Coffee Shop
  + Buck's vs Bucks
  + Trying to use address? Stackbucks vs. Starbucks across the street
  + Best strategy here is to use DM/ML techniques on the *combination* of
    features to determine likelihood of match. We'll discuss specific
    algorithms later in the course

---

## Preprocessing

### Cleaning
fill missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove
outliers, resolve inconsistencies

### Integration
merging data from multiple sources

### Reduction
obtain a smaller data set that can sufficiently answer
important questions

### Transformation
change data to a form that is easier to mine or analyze

???

## Flu Trend Problems (Questions)

  + We have millisecond search resolution, but will only be plotting on a per day basis
  + We have the exact text of each query, but just care if it is about the flu or not
  + Flu Trends, we sometimes see out of control search bots doing 100,000s of searches per day
  + Mobile phone searches and web searches hit different machines, software, logs
  + We have IPs in the logs, but will be plotting against geographical areas

---

## Missing Values

.left-column[
&nbsp;

| Person | Height |
|--------|--------|
| Bob    | 6'0    |
| Ashley | -      |
| Sam    | 5'11   |
| Alice  | 5'9    |
| Kate   | -      |
]
.right-column[
<img src="img/tallest-shortest-man.jpg" width=100% />
]

???

## What to do?
  + (Heights are made up)
  + We want to get an average class height
  + Q: What to do with missing rows?
  + ignore, fill, constant, average, average wrt gender

---

## Fill Missing Values

???

## Details

  + Trade-offs
    + core to engineering

---

## Fill Missing Values

  + Ignore the record

???

## Details

  + Ignore
      + simply drop from data set. Hope there are not too many to affect
        answer. Drawbacks? When missing values are all same class (skew data)

---

## Fill Missing Values

  + Ignore the record
  + Find value manually

???

## Details

  + Find value manually
    + Even for a small class, might be difficult. Get
      ruler, measure them. For historical data, impossible.

---

## Fill Missing Values

  + Ignore the record
  + Find value manually
  + Global constant

???

## Details

  + Global constant
    + replace with "N/A" or "6 foot". Can skew data, or cause
      data to pop in other analysis (all grouped together)

---

## Fill Missing Values

  + Ignore the record
  + Find value manually
  + Global constant
  + Average

???

## Details

  + Average
    + Mean or median.  Either one has potential problems.

---

## Fill Missing Values

  + Ignore the record
  + Find value manually
  + Global constant
  + Average
  + Average with respect to class

???

## Details

  + Average with respect to class
    + gender. Average female/male height to fill
      in values

---

## Fill Missing Values

  + Ignore the record
  + Find value manually
  + Global constant
  + Average
  + Average with respect to class
  + "Most probable"

???

## Details

  + "Most probable"
    + Think of as another step from avg -> class avg.  Now
      throw in other details: age, family history, shoe size. Then weight
      depending on how much those factors are correlated.  Pretty soon you have a
      regression or Bayesian model, which will cover later

---

## Normalization

  + Type of data transformation to make reasoning and comparison easier
  + Is 6' tall?
  + Coefficients on attributes in regressions understandable

???

## Context, Comparison

  + 6' Might be tall for this class, but not on a basketball team
  + How to know when a data point is "average" or towards the top of a range?
  + For our housing model, we wanted to use sq. footage and # of bedrooms. But
    the sq. footage number is huge compared to bedrooms.  If we didn't
    normalize, a formula for determine house price might seem to indicate that #
    of bedrooms was way more important

*Todo: image is transparent and assumes light background*

## Min-max

<img src="img/min-max.gif">

???

## New Range
  + Typically new range is
    + [0-1] (thought of as %)
    + [-1-1] (though of as bad->good

---

*Todo: image is transparent and assumes light background*

## Z-score

<img src="img/z-score.gif" width=100% />

???

## Uses

  + When you want a relative measure of deviation
  + When you have a distribution estimate, but are unsure of absolute min-max

---

*Todo: image scale*

## Comparison

<img src="img/outliers.png" width=100% />
<img src="img/outliers-minmax-zscore.png" width=100% />

???

## Min-max vs Z-score

  + Min-max: Known range
  + Z-score: more expressive range
  + Min-max: requires knowing min-max
  + Z-score: can estimate with sampling or informed guess

---

## Removing Noise

### Binning

create B bins << N data samples, use aggregate statistic of bin
for value

### Regression

fit data to a function, use function value

### Outlier analysis

find outlying points, understand and/or ignore them

???

## Monitoring Problem

  + For the problem encountered in temperature monitoring, which makes the most
    sense?

---

## Trade-offs

### Binning

Simple way to remove outliers, but difficult to pick buckets
correctly

### Regression

If one metric is a direct function of another, what extra
information does the value provide?

### Outlier analysis

Manual process of understanding outliers, ignoring them
can obscure some analysis (e.g., income disparity)

???

## Trade-offs again

  + Remember: this class is exposing you to potential tools, it's up to you
    to be asking the right questions, selecting the appropriate algorithms,
    interpreting results

---

## Data integration

  + Merging two data sources
  + Problem: uniquely identify a concept in both sources
  + Find data points that are very "close" to each other, call them the same
    with some probability
  + Example: [Yelp Menu Data](http://www.yelp.com/menu/tartine-bakery-san-francisco)

???

## Yelp Menu Data

  + Launched menu data in 2012
  + Takes data about the restaurant menu, find reviews & pictures referring to
    the menu item
  + Joins them together
  + Many different metrics for "close": remember them?

---

## Other measures of "close"

Are ```A``` and ```B``` close?

| A  | B   |
|----|-----|
| 2  | 60  |
| 5  | 150 |
| 6  | 180 |
| 10 | 300 |
| 13 | 390 |

???

## Correlation

  + Imagine ```A``` and ```B``` have several different dimensions, maybe things like
    length, height, width, radius
  + Are they similar?
  + On one hand no: clearly different order of magnitude
  + Another way to think about similarity is correlation
  + All of ```B``` dimensions are 30x of ```A```
  + Maybe just using different units!
  + If I plotted ```A``` and ```B``` and x,y, what would the result look like?

---

* Todo: chi? *

## Χ^2 Correlation Test

<img src="img/correlation.png" width=100%/>
<img src="img/chiequation.jpg" width=100%/>

???

## Motivation

  + Answer: a straight line
  + So a correlation coefficient gives a sense of how closely *linearly*
    related two data sets are
  + Note, besides positive & negative, the slope does not affect the correlation
    score, just how well fit the data is
  + Also note I said linear: patterns may still be exhibited, but they are not
    linearly related, eg 30x
  + Details of test are in book, you are expected to understand it
  + Motivation: how different are the observed values from the expected?
  + Expected is calculated using probability with the assumptions that the sets
    are *independent*

---

## Covariance & Correlation

  + Correlation is "normalized" covariance
  + Covariance describes the degree to which two data sets track each other in
    units of the two data sets
  + Correlations describes the degree of similarity without units

???

## Use in industry

  + Χ^2 used most commonly, handy to have an expected [0-1] range
  + "Correlation does not imply causation"
  + A->B, B->A, C->A,B, A->B->A..., coincidence

---

## Data Reduction

### Dimensionality

remove attributes that are the same or similar to other attributes

### Numerosity

represent or aggregate the data, sometimes with precision loss

### Compression

generalized techniques to decrease the number of bytes needed
to store data

???

## Deep Dive

  + We're only going to cover selected topics in these areas.
  + When reading, make sure to understand the intuition behind the other
    techniques, but if we don't cover it in lecture, you won't need to
    calculate it in midterm
  + Ask questions about the concepts you don't understand! That's what
    separates this class from a book :)
  + But still potentially useful for your projects!

---

## Subset Selection

  + Two many attributes?
  + *Ignore some*
  + Tricky part: which to ignore?
  + height x width = area

???

## Simple to Sophisticated

  + Ignore the ones that are not helpful
  + Ignore an attribute highly correlated with another (cm, in)
  + Ignore an attribute that can be built from others

---

## Principal Component Analysis

  + Map data to a location along a few vectors

<img src="img/GaussianScatterPCA.png"/>

???

## Higher dimensions

  + Remember, 2 dimensions might not make much sense, but becomes useful in
    higher number of dimensions
  + These points described by two attributes, <x,y>
  + What if we wanted to describe them in just 1 dimension?
  + Pick some good vectors (in our case 1)
  + Describe where a point is located using only those vectors

---

## Netflix and PCA

  + A user may have many preferences: Mission Impossible, Love Actually, Man
    from Nowhere, ...
  + Instead of keeping track of every preference, we can summarize
  + Action, RomCom, Foreign

???

## Summarize in discovered dimensions

  + With 3 or more "categories", we can reconstruct the user's likely
    preferences
  + Dimensions don't necessarily fit into human notions: probably is not a
    "foreign" dimension, but a subtle combination of other aspects
