  + GitHub pull request:
  + Question # : Correct answer
  + Open book, notes, everything. Cite sources
  + Have slightly more exposition than the midterm requires

## Exposition

  + e.g., if the midterm asks 2 sentences, maybe write 3-4
  + If midterm asks for pseudo code, consider writing Python (though syntax
    will not be graded)

## Why?

  + These questions frequently come up on interviews and in discussions around
    data.
    + "How can you describe a distribution?"
    + "Write out a MapReduce job to calculate click through rates."
    + "How can we tell if a review is duplicated?"
