* Lab: Obtain and Explore Data :slide:
  + Setup GitHub account
  + Find a data set or external API
  + Superficially examine it
  + Summarize findings
  + Submit assignment via GitHub

* Why GitHub? :slide:
  + =git= tool is standard in industry
  + GitHub provides best tools for sharing, commenting code
  + This assignment will not have code, just practice submitting

* Setup GitHub account :slide:
  + Create a [[https://github.com/signup/free][GitHub Account]], making sure to
    use your .edu address
  + Use [[https://github.com/edu][GitHub/Edu]] to request a free micro plan:
    these let us use private accounts

* Setup git repository on ischool server :slide:
  + On the server ischool.berkeley.edu
#+begin_src bash
$ git clone git://github.com/jblomo/datamining290.git
#+end_src
  + On the server, in the datamining290 directory run 
#+begin_src bash
$ git remote rename origin jblomo
#+end_src

* Connect it to GitHub :slide:
  + After you recieve your free micro account on GitHub, create a private repository called datamining290
  + It will provide you with an SSH git path, let's call it PATH
  + On the server, in the datamining290 directory, run
#+begin_src html
$ git remote add origin PATH
$ git push origin
#+end_src

* Share with us :slide:
  + Hopefully you now have a private copy of my repository
  + Add Shreyas and me (users: seekshreyas, jblomo) as a contributor to your private repository

* Obtain Data :slide:
  + Look through the links in slides for interesting data sets, or find your own
  + Or find a service API, like NYTimes
  + Explore the data available to answer the following questions

* Questions :slide:
  + What are the types of data available to you?
  + For data sets: how many records are in the data set?
  + For API: what are the limits on fetching data?
  + Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is
    interesting
  + What are 3 questions you could answer using your data?

* Submit Homework :slide:
  + On the ischool server, create a branch called =hw-obtain-data=
  + Create a text file to write the solution, a simple editor to use is =pico=
  + =git add= the file
  + =git commit= the change
  + =git push origin= to put it on GitHub
  + on github, submit a "pull request" from the =hw-obtain-data= branch to your master branch
** Pull Requests :notes:
   + Pull requests are a way of showing updates in a way that lets me provide
     comments, get notifications
   + This is the first time I've tried it for class, so you're on the cutting
     edge. Hopefully it will work, give me feedback if it is not

* Going Forward :slide:
  + Other homework assignments will be completing code
  + General work-flow:
    + Start a new branch
    + Add required files
    + push to GitHub
    + Submit Pull Request
