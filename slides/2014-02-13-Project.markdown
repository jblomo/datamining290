## Deliverables

  + Project Proposal (due April 9)
  + Code (due April 30)
  + Data (URL or sampled, due April 30)
  + Presentation (May 8)
  + Written Report (due May 14)

---

## Groups

  + 1-3 people

---

## Proposal

  + Informal, not graded
  + A plan for your project
  + After the proposal you should just be executing, not brainstorming
  + Discussions before proposal encouraged

---

## Report

  + Introduction
    + problem, insights, solutions
  + Problem
    + motivation, data set
  + Solution
    + techniques, failures, examples
  + Details
    + parameter tuning, software engineering challenges
  + Related work
    + including resources you used
  + Further work
    + any remaining ideas you have

???

## Notes

  + Length
    + around 2 pages, but more important to hit these points
  + Introduction
    + "gosh, if these insights are true, it would be really
    exciting"
  + Problem
    + include problems with your data set
  + Solution
    + if you do clustering, give examples of a cluster you found and
    individual data points that it contains
  + Details
    + what commands did you use for particular libraries. Can someone
    duplicate your work?
  + Formats
    + PDF, Google Doc

---

## Research Paper

  + [How to write a good research paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-paper-slides.pdf)
  + But much shorter!

???

## Skip sections

  + No abstract
  + Think paragraphs instead of pages

---

## Presentation

  + ~10 minutes
  + Think: 1 slide per paragraph
  + Focus on images, stories, examples
  + Motivate people to read your paper, don't read it to them

---

## Code

  + Another GitHub repository
  + Public is best, but if private then add Shreyas and me
  + Include README with info on how to run algorithms
  + Suggestion: include your paper

???

## Reproducible

  + Imagine if someone wanted to reproduce your results
  + Also great for portfolio (with Paper)

---

## Data

  + If large, just point to URL in paper and README
    + git is not very good at handling large data files, don't commit large
      datasets
  + If very large, talk with me about hosting on Amazon Web Services
  + We'll have computing resources available from Amazon
